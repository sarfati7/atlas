# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** A new developer can onboard in minutes instead of weeks by seeing everything their team has built
**Current focus:** Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Phase 2

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Foundation & Data Architecture)
Plan: 5 of 5 in current phase
Status: Phase 1 COMPLETE
Last activity: 2026-01-23 - Completed 01-05-PLAN.md (Git-to-Database Sync Mechanism)

Progress: [=====.....] 13%

## Performance Metrics

- Average duration: 3.6 min
- Total execution time: 0.30 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 5 | 18 min | 3.6 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5 min), 01-02 (3 min), 01-03 (3 min), 01-04 (3 min), 01-05 (4 min)
- Trend: stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Git stores ONLY content, PostgreSQL stores ALL metadata (critical separation)
- [Roadmap]: RBAC abstractions needed from day one (even if policy is "allow all" for v1)
- [Roadmap]: Profile versioning built into data model from start
- [Roadmap]: CLI needs atomic sync operations (write to temp, then move)
- [Roadmap]: MCP security controls required (consent flows, not auto-execute)
- [01-01]: Used Pydantic BaseModel for domain entities to keep domain layer pure (no SQLModel)
- [01-01]: Single CatalogItem entity with type enum discriminator (SKILL/MCP/TOOL)
- [01-01]: uv as package manager (10-100x faster than Poetry)
- [01-02]: SQLModel tables separate from domain entities (domain purity maintained)
- [01-02]: expire_on_commit=False for async session factory (critical for async context)
- [01-02]: Manual initial migration (autogenerate requires running database)
- [01-04]: asyncio.to_thread for PyGithub (sync library with async interface)
- [01-04]: Conditional content repository (GitHub if configured, else in-memory)
- [01-04]: Permissive authorization for Phase 1 (all checks return True)
- [01-05]: System author UUID (all zeros) for webhook-created items
- [01-05]: HMAC SHA-256 signature verification for webhook security
- [01-05]: Directory prefix mapping for type detection (skills/ -> SKILL, etc.)
