## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Git stores ONLY content, PostgreSQL stores ALL metadata (critical separation)
- [Roadmap]: RBAC abstractions needed from day one (even if policy is "allow all" for v1)
- [Roadmap]: Profile versioning built into data model from start
- [Roadmap]: CLI needs atomic sync operations (write to temp, then move)
- [Roadmap]: MCP security controls required (consent flows, not auto-execute)
